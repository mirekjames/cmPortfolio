## Reflections on Rules and Meanings

I created the following pieces in Anastasia Salter's Spring 2024 Critical Making course at the University of Central Florida. Each piece is created using a different tool and presents a unique perspective on the rules and play generate meaning.

The first piece is a cross-stitch self-portrait, created as a nonogram puzzle. I used this nonogram generator to turn a silhouette of my face into a nonogram puzzle, and then solved the puzzle using cross-stitch embroidery. At the end of the puzzle, I discovered that there were multiple solutions that abided by the puzzle's rules. I intentionally chose a solution that did not match the original image, demonstrating how procedural ambiguity can produce unexpected meanings.

The second piece, *Rules as Written*, is a comic about Supreme Court jurisprudence. Using collage methods, I explored the intersections between legal rules and game rules and how they are interpreted. 

The third piece, created in Twine, invites the player to establish their own rule set. Hypertexts produce meaning through links between ideas, events, images. This disconnected set of passages invites the player to create their own links between poetic lines.

My game *what's all this about?* directly asks the player to interpret each of the game's events. As Wardrip-Fruin argues, a game's meanings are generated through the combination of rules and representations. Adam Le Doux's game engine [bitsy](https://www.bitsy.org/), is ideal for exploring how representations of space and collision logics convey ideas. Kate Compton's [Tracery](https://tracery.io/) text generator introduces new permutations of resources gained and lost. With every collision, the player is asked "what just happened?".

The final piece, *Justice*, combines bitsy, Tracery, and Twine to once again engage with methods of legal interpretation. Matthew R. F. Balousek's [twinecery](https://github.com/mrfb/twinecery?tab=readme-ov-file) is used to generate the constitution of a fictional country. The player is a justice of that country's highest court, and must determine if and how a given law might contradict the constitution. Each legal decision is punctuated by the striking of a gavel, created in Bitsy using Sean S. LeBlanc's [twine bitsy comms](https://github.com/seleb/bitsy-hacks/blob/main/dist/twine-bitsy-comms.js) and [multi-sprite avatar](https://github.com/seleb/bitsy-hacks/blob/main/dist/multi-sprite-avatar.js) hacks.
