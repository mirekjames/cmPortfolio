## Reflections on Rules and Meanings

In a collection titled *Your Computer is on Fire*, the stakes of Noah Wardrip-Fruin's chapter "You Can't Make Games About Much" may appear small. Wardrip-Fruin's operational logics framework outlines the fundamental ways that games produce meaning, and the "vast gulf betweeen what can be said in this vocabulary and what games promise to be about" (232). Games have underlying rules that are surfaced to the player with representations that might take verbal, visual, aural, or other forms. What the computer understands as an overlap between two programmed boxes becomes a collision between go-karts when players interpret how the rules and representations combine. In my scholarship, I have used operational logics to analyze colonialist themes in board games and to unpack the relationships between analog and digital games. I created the following pieces in Anastasia Salter's Spring 2024 Critical Making course at the University of Central Florida. Each piece is created using a different tool and presents a unique perspective on the ways that rules and play generate meaning, and how rules interpretation intersects with law.

The first piece is a cross-stitch self-portrait, created as a nonogram puzzle. I used this [nonogram generator](https://iamtoolbox.com/nonogram-generator/) to turn a silhouette of my face into a nonogram puzzle, and then solved the puzzle using cross-stitch embroidery. At the end of the puzzle, I discovered that there were multiple solutions that abided by the puzzle's rules. I intentionally chose a solution that did not match the original image, demonstrating how procedural ambiguity can produce unexpected meanings. A face distorted by a mismatch between puzzle constraints and visual representation.

My game *what's all this about?* directly asks the player to interpret each of the game's events. Adam Le Doux's game engine [bitsy](https://www.bitsy.org/), is ideal for exploring how representations of space and collision logics convey ideas. Kate Compton's [Tracery](https://tracery.io/) text generator introduces new permutations of resources gained and lost. With every collision, the player is asked "what just happened?". The third piece, created in Twine, goes a step further by inviting the player to establish their own rule set. Hypertexts produce meaning through links between ideas, events, images. This disconnected set of passages invites the player to create their own links between poetic lines.

Yet, rules do not exist only in games. In legal domains, rules interpretations have high stakes. *Rules as Written* is a comic about Supreme Court interpretive methods. Textualism's supposedly strict adherence to legal text. Originalism's deference to slave owners. Using collage methods, I explored the intersections between legal rules and game rules and how they are interpreted. Do tabletop gaming assumptions about rules clarity extend outside of games? What happens when we consider laws as rules, or rules as laws? The final piece, *Justice*, combines bitsy, Tracery, and Twine to once again engage with methods of legal interpretation. Matthew R. F. Balousek's [twinecery](https://github.com/mrfb/twinecery?tab=readme-ov-file) is used to generate the constitution of a fictional country. The player is a justice of that country's highest court, and must determine if and how a given law might contradict the constitution. Each legal decision is punctuated by the striking of a gavel, created in Bitsy using Sean S. LeBlanc's [twine bitsy comms](https://github.com/seleb/bitsy-hacks/blob/main/dist/twine-bitsy-comms.js) and [multi-sprite avatar](https://github.com/seleb/bitsy-hacks/blob/main/dist/multi-sprite-avatar.js) hacks.
